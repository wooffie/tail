public final ObjectProperty<Node> rightProperty
The node placed on the right edge of this border pane. If resizable, it will be resized to its preferred width and it's height will span the height of the border pane between the top and bottom nodes. If the node cannot be resized to fill the right space (it's not resizable or its max size prevents it) then it will be aligned top-right within the space unless the child's alignment constraint has been set.
